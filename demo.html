                                        different experiences behind their stories that define different

                        <p class="the-world-may-seem-lroboto-semi-bold-schooner-16px">
                            The world may seem like a big place, but we can't really go very far. For us, it is just a
                            small
                            corner. We eat, sleep and work
                            in the same way in this cramped space, day in and day out.<br /><br />We are depressed,
                            miserable, anxious and restless. We long
                            for freedom, but freedom itself is only an illusion. Fortunately, there is a window called
                            "light and shadow" in this space, and
                            the view from it is beautiful. Through this window, we can see the stars above and the light
                            below. We can see the sun and the
                            moon together and the prosperity of the world.<br /><br />In the 24 frames of light and
                            shadow,
                            thousands of lives are lived
                            with optimism and pessimism. They embrace love and hate, feel joy and sorrow, experience
                            life
                            and death. They carry their
                            ideals, they search for existence, they fight for their love, they are
                            legends.<br /><br />When
                            you've seen a thousand different
                            lives, you've seen heaven and earth and felt all beings. The 1,001th possibility of living
                            that
                            life is to see yourself again
                            after having seen heaven and earth and all beings.<br /><br />Yes, when we are anxious,
                            confused
                            and underestimated, a good film
                            can bring us relax, enlighten and inspire or follow the characters in a film and experience
                            a
                            different kind of life that we
                            have never known before.<br /><br />If you are at a low point and have a lot of things
                            weighing
                            on your mind that you can't get
                            rid of, why not stop living? Why not stop your step and watch a film? Hopefully, for a
                            moment,
                            it will save you from your
                            depression.

                                    Looking back on the past few years, the biggest change is that the fervour for film
                                    or
                                    movie has gradually been tempered,
                                    and more enthusiasm has been thrown into the scenes of life, and as a result, we
                                    have
                                    come to appreciate those moments that
                                    are often overlooked but precious. We have always misunderstood ourselves, mistaking
                                    a
                                    momentary impulse for an enduring
                                    passion, when the raw power of fascination is often found in the routine of
                                    life.<br /><br />In the past two years, I have
                                    travelled from place to place, examining my old life with fresh experiences, my
                                    thoughts
                                    and horizons have widened a little
                                    in the unknown frontier, and when I sit in front the movie again, my viewing
                                    perception
                                    is completely overturned and
                                    rebuilt, but I find myself enjoying the process more than ever.<br /><br />The
                                    choice of
                                    the films recommended on this
                                    website is purely based on a thought, without much distinction of ranking
                                    preferences,
                                    nor do I want to tinker with them for
                                    the sake of some obsession, I prefer to believe that the most genuine choice is the
                                    one
                                    that is made without thinking.

                                A good movie gives you a wider perspective and makes you think more, rather than simply
                                pursuing visual stimulation. The
                                meaning of a film is like the meaning of life, the meaning of life is in life itself,
                                the
                                meaning of a film is in the film
                                itself. Sometimes the philosophy in movie is more interesting than books, also more
                                understandable than life.<br /><br />Film
                                has prolonged our life by almost three times, it has taught us many things that we would
                                never have understood in a lifetime.
                                Review our life from a different perspective, accept the reality that you are ultimately
                                ordinary, but never give up the
                                pursuit of your ideals, to be kind-hearted, love our life and enjoy the moment. Perhaps
                                if
                                you understand this, you will
                                understand the true meaning of life.

                                In the hundred years since its inception, cinema has gone from being a novel form of
                                entertainment to an all-encompassing
                                seventh art.<br /><br />The six traditional classical arts are architecture, painting,
                                sculpture, music, dance and poetry. Of
                                these, architecture and music are considered to be the main forms of art, painting and
                                sculpture complement architecture,
                                while dance and poetry are integrated into music.<br /><br />Traditionally theatre/drama
                                was
                                known as the eighth art, while
                                games are now known as the ninth art.<br /><br />But film has the distinction of
                                encompassing all other forms of artistic
                                expression, resulting in an integrated viewing experience.<br /><br />It can tell a
                                story,
                                it can also highlight forms like
                                poetry, the rhythm of music and the form of architecture, he can also take theatre with
                                him,
                                and it can also extend the
                                experience of 3D, 4D, 5D, VR and so on for games.<br /><br />All in all, film is about
                                two
                                things: the content and the
                                situation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Content
                                is
                                something based on text, just
                                like reading a book, a novel of several hundred thousand words can be condensed into a
                                two-hour film.<br /><br />Likewise, an
                                excellent film can be unfolded into a book of several hundred thousand words
                                already.<br /><br />A person who loves to read
                                can recline on the sofa at any time of the day, listening to music and reading a book
                                with
                                great pleasure.<br /><br />And the
                                combined experience that can be gained from a proper film is much more complex than
                                reading
                                a book.<br /><br />Because it is a
                                constant flow of musical images, it must be an hour or more long to maintain a high
                                level of
                                concentration and is a great test
                                of reading ability.<br /><br />Countless times I have seen people eating popcorn and
                                drinking soft drinks in the cinema and
                                chatting about it, then jumping up when the lights come on and saying "shit" and
                                leaving.
                                They didn't even watch the movie,
                                they just went to the cinema to have a chat. If you want them to watch a movie
                                seriously,
                                it's not possible anymore. These
                                people have lost their basic reading skills and can't even finish a few hundred words,
                                so
                                how can you expect them to keep
                                their attention for two hours?<br /><br />Add a bit more formality to the mix and it's
                                even
                                more confusing.<br /><br />If you
                                go to the cinema with a world-class master score, you will only feel your eardrums being
                                shaken, and the rhythm and melody
                                will not match the story, so you will not have time to enjoy the picturesque beauty of
                                the
                                shots.

                            The colour palette, the layers of light and shadow, the composition, the camera movement,
                            the
                            architecture, the interiors, the
                            costume design, the acting, the meaning of the lines, they are invisible.<br /><br />A good
                            film
                            is a mirror, your mind are deep
                            and he is deep, your mind are light and he is light. The vast majority of good films are
                            difficult to appreciate in their
                            entirety after only one viewing.<br /><br />Nowadays, there is a clear polarisation between
                            the
                            two types of film viewing: many
                            people watch a film many times over, and it has become the norm to watch it twice or three
                            times. And some of them can't
                            understand anything and can only curse the director on the internet for not being able to
                            make a
                            film.<br /><br />There is a
                            very strange comment that watching a film is about watching a story, and not being too
                            complicated.<br /><br />Film was never
                            meant to be a storytelling tool, otherwise why not just read a book at home. What is the
                            logic
                            of criticising a film for being
                            too profound because you are superficial and ignorant?<br /><br />Creation is always
                            subjective,
                            and any art form is an
                            expression of the author's thoughts, while film is probably the most "objective" art
                            form.<br /><br />The script, shooting,
                            acting, music, editing, special effects and compositing are all done by different people,
                            and
                            it's quite a team, with the
                            director and producer doing a lot of the management work. For commercial films in
                            particular,
                            the director is a labourer and
                            does not have all the decisions.<br /><br />In fact a great deal of films are biased towards
                            content, and if the director
                            packages and hides his sense of ideas, it makes the whole film more difficult to
                            understand.<br /><br />If you want to see films
                            with content, you necessarily have to expand your reading.<br /><br />Some Hollywood films,
                            because they are industrial
                            products, have been made in such a way that the form is so extreme that the content is
                            instead
                            weakened and there is not much to
                            think about. But it is not for everyone, either. The test is the comprehensive training in
                            the
                            classical arts.<br /><br />Going
                            formal, is also art.<br /><br />Only by insisting on improving one's reading and striving to
                            enhance one's appreciation of
                            various arts can one first ensure that one understands the content of the film before it
                            becomes
                            an effective form of
                            entertainment. It is only after watching the film that something can be gained.
